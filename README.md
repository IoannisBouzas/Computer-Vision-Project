# Computer-Vision-Project

## Project Description

This repository contains my solutions for the Computer Vision (MYE046) course assignment from the Winter Semester 2024-2025. The assignment focuses on implementing machine learning and deep learning techniques for handwritten digit classification using the MNIST dataset. The project is divided into two main parts:

- Part 1: Machine Learning

    - Data Visualization: Plotting MNIST digit samples.

    - Logistic Regression & k-NN Classifiers: Implementation and evaluation using Scikit-learn.

    - Confusion Matrix: Custom implementation to analyze model performance.

    - PCA + k-NN: Dimensionality reduction with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) followed by k-Nearest Neighbors classification.

    - Custom k-NN Implementation: A manual k-NN classifier without external libraries.


- Part 2: Deep Learning

  - Environment Setup: Instructions for PyTorch installation (local/Colab).

  - Data Loading: Using PyTorchâ€™s torchvision to load the full MNIST dataset.

  - High-Resolution Visualization: Enhanced plotting of digit samples.

  - Bonus Task: Custom neural network implementation using PyTorch.
